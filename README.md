# PalindromeTest

This is a web app to accept a user input and determine if it is a palindrome.

## Description

A common technical interview task is to write a function to determine if a string is a palindrome. I wrote the original JavaScript after an interview to see how I could clean it up, and resolve a test case which included non-alphanumeric characters (spaces or punctuation). I decided afterwards, that it might make a cool page.
