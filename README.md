# PalindromeTest

## Description

A common technical interview task is to write a function to determine if a string is a palindrome. I re-wrote the original JavaScript after an interview to see how I could clean it up, and resolve a test case which included non-alphanumeric characters (spaces or punctuation). Later, I decided that it might make a cool app.
